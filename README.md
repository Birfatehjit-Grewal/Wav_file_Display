# Wav_file_Display
This application uses a GUI created with Java swing which allows the user to open a wav file and display it as a graph. The open file GUI filters out all files thats are not wav file or directories to make chosing the file easy. The application reads the file and extracts information like the number of smaples, the sample frequency and the left and right channels. The GUI uses a scaling to plot the wav file each of the channels.
